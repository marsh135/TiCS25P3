**Topics in CS 2025 Project 3 -  Survey Design and Data Analysis**

**Objective**
- You will design your own small-scale survey, collect data (or simulate realistic data if needed), analyze it with pandas, and present the results visually using matplotlib.

**Steps**
- Design Your Survey
  - Choose a topic that interests you (e.g., favorite apps, study habits, sleep schedules, snack preferences, gaming habits, etc.).
  - Create at least 5 questions:
     - At least 2 should be multiple choice or categorical.
     - At least 2 should be numeric (ratings, counts, hours, etc.).
  - Create a simple online form (Google Forms, Microsoft Forms, paper, etc.) or just plan your survey questions.
 - Collect or Simulate Data
- Aim for 20–30 responses.
   - If you can’t collect real data, generate fake but plausible data in Python. (For example, random integers for age, random choices for “favorite snack,” etc.)
 - Load Data with Pandas
    - Import your dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
  - Clean the data:
     - Handle missing values.
     - Convert data types (strings to categories, numbers to int/float).
     - Rename columns to be clear and readable.
  - Analyze Your Data
     - Use pandas to compute at least:
        - Descriptive stats (mean, median, mode, counts).
        - GroupBy analysis (e.g., average hours of sleep by grade level).
        - Sorting/filtering for interesting insights.
   - Visualize Your Data with Matplotlib:
      - Create at least 3 different charts:
         - One bar chart (categorical data).
         - One histogram or boxplot (numeric data distribution).
         - One line chart or scatter plot (showing a relationship between two variables).
         - Add:
            - Titles, axis labels, and legends.
            - Colors or styles that make it clear and readable.
   - Present Your Findings
      - Summarize your key insights in a short report (or slide deck).
      - Include the charts and a brief explanation of what they show.
      - Submit your Python code and your cleaned dataset along with the report.


**Example Project Ideas**
 - Study habits vs. GPA.
 - Favorite streaming platform vs. hours per week.
 - Daily screen time vs. average sleep.
 - Students’ coffee/energy drink consumption and class performance.
